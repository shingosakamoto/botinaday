# Hands-On Workshop

In this workshop, we will cover the Microsoft Cognitive and Bot offerings through various demos and presentations. We will also get an opportunity to work hands-on with these offerings by writing code in Python for NLP scenarios.

At the end of the session participants will have a good sense of Microsoft offerings for creating Bots, leveraging our cognitive services and using Python to build simple NLP models.
